    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Despite quietness in last week of March regarding new sales, urea prices were firmer in most areas. Producers committed much of their tonnage for April, with one or two exceptions, and pushed prices up slowly for any remaining urea.

Traders were unwilling to sell short against this background but do not have enough confidence in the market for May to take long positions either.

Chinese producers were holding prices around $210/t fob for first half April, with many asking much higher, and this was underpinning the overall market. Producers elsewhere are not under pressure to meet competition from China.

Brazilian prices have moved up to $205-210/t cfr for granular urea. Egyptian urea sold at $228-231/t fob. Yuzhny urea moved up to the high-$190s/t fob and Baltic suppliers were seeing bids in the high-$180s/t fob. Anyone needing to buy urea for April loading will be squeezed to pay up.

The overall supply-demand balance for April shows the urea market in surplus. But with China, which accounts for over 25pc of world exports, pricing itself out of the market, the rest of the planet is arguably in deficit.

The question is how long will this last?

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Reduced gas supply since 24 March has forced the closure of all but one urea factory in the country; Mopco III is running at about 60pc of capacity. The duration of the closures is uncertain, but producers were hopeful that gas supply would be restored in early-April. The reduction in gas supply is attributed to delays in LNG deliveries due to payment issues.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Libya</h4>
Yara was in the market for a vessel to load 13,000t of urea prompt in MEB for the US Gulf.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ghana</h4>
The government has allocated subsidies for 180,000t of NPKs and urea for the 2016-17 season, starting 1 April. Allocations are split between several companies as follows: Chemico - 50,000t, Afcott - 40,000t, AMG West Africa - 40,000t, Yara - 10,000t, Olam - 10,000t, LDC - 10,000t, Iddisal - 10,000t and ETG Agro - 10,000t.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
India has tendered heavily with perhaps 400,000t DAP purchased in a $340-350/t cfr range. The interest has surprised some, given the high stocks due to heavy importing in 2015. If one runs the numbers at $350/t cfr an importer can sell to the domestic market at around Rs 19,500/t and break even. So this looks to be taking advantage of the higher MRP at Rs 23,700/t. Most of the importers are thought to have secured relatively small volumes last year, and at these prices there appears to be little risk. Cfr prices continue to edge down on each new sale. On the plus side, the larger buyers such as IPL are now actively taking cargoes. 

Elsewhere the market is fairly quiet. Brazilian import demand is very lacklustre, with prices slowing eroding to $350-360/t cfr on minimal trade. Buying is expected to ramp up in May as the season approaches. But buyers have time on their side and an expectation that Chinese availability will increase in May. Argentina has performed more robustly but the volume of trader positions and vessels heading there for March and April shipment is considerable, and may limit price rises in the meantime. 

Meanwhile the US domestic market slipped marginally as the season winds down. The Tampa DAP price held steady at $360/t fob.

Overall, the market looks flat at best in Latin America, weaker in the US, and further downwards pressure is evident east of Suez. Chinese availability of DAP and 11-44 after the spring season ends will ultimately keep a lid on pricing. The unexpected level of interest in India gives Chinese producers something to put their back up against, although Saudi product will feature heavily too. Equally, more 11-44 will be available after April as the Chinese domestic season recedes.    <br><br><br><br>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
Around 8,000t GCT DAP has been sold to Turkey at $365/t fob with credit. Production is running at around 60-70pc of capacity. 


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP confirmed the sale of 3 x 35,000t MAP to Brazil netting the mid-$350s/t fob for April shipment. It additionally sold two 40,000t DAP/MAP cargoes to traders for shipment to Argentina in April at a level of the low/mid-$350s/t fob. The sale was made on an fob basis. It also has a DAP vessel for Bangladesh in April plus a cargo of TSP. A further 150,000-200,000t will ship to various African markets. Overall the producer is comfortable for April but has yet to conclude 2Q phosphoric acid contracts with its Indian buyers.



    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
The potash market has entered a distinct hiatus period. West of Suez the market is stabilizing, but in the east, China is beset with high stocks, estimated at 2.5-2.6mn t. It is in no hurry to buy more potash imports, and most expect contract negotiations not to start in earnest until the second quarter. Stocks are slowly being eroded from the ports, but not in the volumes required to pull in more material.
India will only spring to life once China agrees its contracts. There is similarly no imminent demand for potash and it needs to draw down its own stocks during April and May.
Southeast Asia is similarly quiet, and most plantation demand is covered in the near term. Observers expect the next round of purchasing to begin in 2H April or early May.
In the west, most Brazilian demand for April shipment has been covered (shipments are healthy), and some sellers report sales for May at the $240/t cfr level, which other observers say is possible for certain buyers. The season is approaching for May shipment onwards in time for seasonal application on soybean.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">West Africa</h4>
There are some enquiries circulating from buyers in markets including Nigeria and Ivory Coast, for small lots of MOP (generally ranging 3,000-7,000t lots) as part of combination cargoes, but no confirmed sales have been reported.
The Democratic Republic of Congo government recently requested 1,500t of granular MOP in containers on a cfr Matadi (50kg bags) basis. An offer as low as $210/t fob Baltic Sea bulk equivalent was tabled, according to traders.
