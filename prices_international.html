<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Much of the last week of July was spent waiting in the urea market to see at what level traders would offer urea in the Indian tender. In the event, the prices in the tender and the tonnage offered were slightly bearish.
The lowest price equates to about $270/t fob China, assuming a small margin on the sale, while the 2.7m tonnes offered firm indicated a large number of willing sellers.
The impact of the tender is seen as neutral in other areas. The netback from west coast prices is in the high-$270s/t fob Middle East, which is likely to be accepted by Iranian suppliers but not by the AG, where quotes for spot cargoes are $287-288/t fob. No Black Sea urea is likely to move to India in August, based on a price close to $260/t fob, below levels obtainable elsewhere.
Assuming Chinese urea prices realign to permit sales to India, we anticipate some additional buying will take place during August from importers that have been hesitant until now. This may even extend to Brazil, where a drop in the currency cut off putative buyers.
Prices drifted lower in the US, trying to find a support level for the off-season. Granular barges traded in the high-$270s/st fob Nola, equivalent to about $280/t fob Middle East. But support has been evident at $280/st since the start of July and some rebound in prices is possible as we move towards river close.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria </h4>
AOA is indicating that it will have cargoes of 10-25,000t of granular urea to ship from 20 August onwards.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
There are no new offers of urea for export. Urea factories were shut down again this week due to lack of gas. Trammo is shipping 3,000t of granular urea to Greece, purchased from HFC under last week’s tender. Dreymoor also has a small cargo of HFC granular urea to lift.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East Africa</h4>
The market is active with shipping inquiries ahead of the peak season for deliveries to the region. Traders are offering granular urea at $310/t cfr for August shipment from the AG, based on freights of around $25/t. Blue Deebaj is negotiating 15-20,000t of bagged prilled urea for end-August/early- September shipment from China.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Gavilon has been linked with a combined cargo of 40,000t of Chinese granular urea and 10,000t of MAP from YUC for August shipment to Durban. Prices for granular urea have eased to about $295/t cfr in Durban, with freight from the AG $15-16/t for 25,000t cargoes.

</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
A stable-to-firm US domestic market has got the market excited. A 60,000t DAP cargo is loading in China for the US and PhosAgro will also ship there in August as will OCP. 

In the absence of almost any other liquidity, clearly, the US is a market of interest, given that Brazil continues to languish. The lack of credit has been little short of disastrous for Brazilian farmers and MAP imports have suffered as a result. There seems little chance of Brazil bouncing back now in terms of volumes bought or price. The producer response has been to limit exposure to this market while one supplier diverted a cargo from Brazil to the US. With trader length diminishing and substantial volumes available only from the Moroccans, prices appear to have bottomed out in early August.

Even so, at current prices, India still provides a better netback to Chinese producers relative to the US domestic - closer to the mid-$450s/t fob for DAP to the US versus almost $10/t higher for India. But as traders point out, China has yet to sell for September and there must be hope that US domestic prices will appreciate further. Feedback after the major domestic fertilizer conference has been mostly positive. Distribution systems are dry. Clearly, the US represents an outlet for fairly significant tonnage.

The outlook is one of market stability. India still needs to cover significant volumes but will be conscious of falling prices in Latin America. For Brazil it looks too late for any major price appreciation. Producers will limit shipments as a result, favouring the US domestic market where possible. Traders will find it hard to take positions on Russian MAP at $475/t fob when Brazil is bidding $470/t cfr. As a result, limited demand will be met with limited supply.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP reports that granulation for DAP/MAP and NPKs will be around 400,000t for August, with the new 1mn t/year plant still in ramp up mode and OCP still shipping substantial phosphoric acid volumes to India. OCP’s August DAP/MAP/NPK commitments are as follows: 
100,000t to Europe
50,000t to the US
100,000t to Brazil
100,000t to Africa (including South Africa)
25,000t to Bangladesh
50,000t to the domestic market
TOTAL: 425,000t

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
Tunisian phosphate producer GCT has restarted DAP and TSP production following a resumption of rock supply, the producer has confirmed.

Production had been halted for several weeks due to protests by unemployed locals disrupting rock supply to the plants from the rock mining region of Gafsa.

One line of DAP is running and overall production is at 40-50pc of capacity. It is expected to stay at this running rate for August and September. 

According to buyers, GCT is evaluating its pricing policy. On TSP, production at Gafsa has also restarted and GCT is reportedly running at 60-70pc of overall capacity. All TSP availability is currently earmarked for Bangladesh under contract.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
It is now estimated that as many as 12 phosphate cargoes have been placed into South Africa over the last couple of months:
- up to five OCP cargoes mostly for Foskor
- three Russian vessels, some of which were reportedly taken by Gavilon
- three Saudi vessels through ETG
- one Chinese combination cargo


<br><br><br><br>

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
The announcement of tenders in India and Sri Lanka alongside open demand in Central and South America, were the talking points during a quiet last week of July.  Spot business was limited with several markets, including Europe, in the low season for fertilizer trade. In most cases, spot prices were holding steady awaiting greater clarity in the next round of purchases.

India’s National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) has announced a tender for 50,000t closing on 21 August. While the price will be a formality – at the headline contract level of $332/t cfr including 180 days’ credit – it affords suppliers the opportunity to place additional tonnes.

Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Agriculture has also announced a tender for 25,000t of MOP closing on 7 August. Sri Lanka has been consistently tendering for standard MOP over recent months providing a useful outlet for sellers.

In contrast to these positives, Brazil remains a major concern for the market and demand continues to disappoint. Traditionally, the Brazilian market would be a focus this time of year, actively buying MOP for the upcoming application season. However, the market remains slow, dogged by financial insecurity, a depreciating local currency and high potash stock at ports. Suppliers have reassessed their price targets to secure business, prompting a decline in cfr levels.

The short-medium term outlook for the market remains uncertain. How Brazil develops over the coming weeks will be significant as will the appetite of the major Southeast Asian buyers in the next series of tenders. Heavy contract shipments to China and India continue to occupy suppliers in the meantime.


Africa
Suppliers note steady demand in East and South Africa for small lots of MOP.  APC was checking freight for 24,000t of bulk fertilizers loading in Aqaba end-July/early August, for shipment to Durban, South Africa. A mixed grade sale is thought to have been concluded but no further details were disclosed.

BPC has now indicated a price of $393/t cfr Dar es Salaam in big bags, for its recent 4,000t granular MOP sale to a Rwandan buyer. The buyer will take delivery from the Tanzanian port.

Demand for container lots is steady for countries including Mozambique in East Africa. In South Africa, demand is healthy with granular MOP sale to a Rwandan buyer. The buyer will take delivery from the Tanzanian port.

Demand for container lots is steady for countries including Mozambique in East Africa. In South Africa, demand is healthy with granular MOP priced around $350/t cfr.
