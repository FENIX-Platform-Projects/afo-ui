            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
            The ninth week of declining prices has brought us closer to the floor in urea but left no one any clearer about where it will be found. Black Sea and Baltic pilled urea is being sold in the $250s/t fob, $10-15/t lower than current prices in China, with no indication that any FSU producer is contemplating cutting output.
Middle East granular urea is on offer in Brazil at $275/t cfr, equivalent to $255-260/t fob, but finding no takers. Buyers there have become inured to the constant fall in prices and cannot be lured into the market until they are absolutely ready. This price too is comfortably below current Chinese asking prices in the $270s/t fob.
A reduction in supply is needed because there is little in terms of new demand for April that could halt the decline in prices. India appears to have decided 
Elsewhere, demand is either winding down after the spring season or yet to wind up. Any sign that prices are bottoming out will send buyers scurrying into the market to cover, but we still appear to be some weeks away from that eventuality.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
AOA is understood to have produced some quantities of on-spec urea at its new plant in Algeria. Offtake agreements have yet to be finalized with trading companies and export licenses have also to be obtained, so the first shipments of granular urea from the complex are expected to take place in April or May.
            
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
            In the first spot sale for some time, Helwan Fertilizer sold 6-7,000t of granular urea to Trammo at $300/t fob Damietta. 
The urea will load prompt for Greece from product in store at the port.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Lybia</h4>
            Lifeco is producing on one line of urea at about 1,000t/day.
            
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
            The phosphates market remained under pressure in March, with significant trader length in Latin American largely unabsorbed. Hence Brazilian cfr prices for MAP fell to $470-475/t cfr. A depreciating real, unconvincing macro-economic sentiment, heavy stocks and poor weather all combined to dampen demand. 
The US was also a major disappointment, with heavy Moroccan shipments in March alarming the market, despite the exit of MissPhos tonnage in Q4. Wet weather also hit interest and weighed on sentiment. 
Tampa DAP prices slipped marginally on latest business in central America, with Mosaic reporting sales at $470-$475/t fob.
Europe was affected by a weak Euro which made DAP imports expensive. OCP accordingly lowered its price to $520/t fob. Rising Tunisian output also weighed on regional supply and the lack of European demand saw Russia export DAP to India for the first time in several years. 
News that OCP had finally agreed 1H phosphoric acid contracts in India at an elevated price of $805/t P2O5 cfr was initially greeted with some skepticism, given that it constituted a rise of $40/t P2O5 in an otherwise flat to bearish market worldwide. However, falling ammonia prices in India offset the higher price of acid. And when raised MRP levels are taken into account, the new price more or less works for Indian DAP producers. Moreover, there was concern in India regarding production levels for March. Given the lack of acid supply, and some speculate that government intervention was also at work to get a settlement agreed. Either way, the news brings some stability to the market east of Suez. It has scant effect on DAP pricing in India, which hovers around the high- $470s/low-$480s/t cfr level. Indian importers still fundamentally see the market as soft internationally. DAP demand in India remained strong, with 600,000t booked for March shipment onwards, keeping Chinese and Saudi DAP producers largely occupied. 
Looking forward, it is hard to see much upside in the market until Latin American trader is absorbed or weather in the US improve. India will provide a baseload, possibly for more producers than originally envisaged as netback here are comparable to other deep-sea markets. Ultimately, multiple markets need to move into season at the same time for a price recovery to take hold.
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
For March OCP sold around 20,000t DAP to Spain at $520/t fob having allocated a total of 70,000-80,000t to Europe for shipment.
Last week OCP shipped a 50,000t DAP/MAP cargo to the US and is currently loading a second 50,000t DAP/MAP parcel for the same destination. It loaded its second post-panamax (90,000t DAP/MAP) to the US at the beginning of the month. 

There was also 25,000t DAP for Bangladesh under contract. 
There were three 30,000t mainly MAP vessels for Brazil for OCP’s own distribution system. 
Notably, OCP’s shipments to Africa in March were high, with 50,000t NPS to Ethiopia under an old tender award, 25,000t NPKs for the Ivory Coast, 25,000t for Nigeria and 
DAP/MAP/NPK granulation will be around 40,000t for March. Granulation will be similar in April but this depend on the the volume of phosphoric acid shipments to India.

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
            GCT is understood to have sold 10,000t of DAP to Gubretas in Turkey for March shipment. Its production is estimated at 50-60pc of capacity.


            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>

            The potash market now has its long-awaited significant benchmark for 2015 prices, following the $10 increase agreed by BPC that Argus FMB was the first to report. Buyers around the world have been digesting the news and it is already starting to have an impact. Some companies in Malaysia have already made enquiries for standard MOP while the suppliers also believe prices in Brazil have bottomed out. In NW Europe prices for granular MOP have started to move up by €5-10/t although the US dollar equivalent is still very low compared to other regions, due to the weak Euro.
As BPC now has a baseload of perhaps 700,000t MOP to ship to China over the remainder of the first half of 2015, other suppliers are hoping that it will not be so eager for business. Accusations that it was pulling prices down should subside.
The next major market to settle is India. Uralkali has not made any price proposal to Indian buyers as yet but reports are already circulating that it will be looking for $20-25/t above the previous contract price of $322/t cfr, including 180 days. Indian buyers want a roll-over not surprisingly.
ICL’s production in Israel is still halted by the strike and now SQM has stopped production after flash floods in the normally arid Atacama Desert. The latter should resume fairly quickly but again it squeezes availability.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
Uralkali has sold 15,000t standard MOP to OCP for shipment in March. The price has not been disclosed

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South & West Africa</h4>
APC has sales totalling 25,000t MOP to be shipped in bulk during April and May to south Africa, Mozambique, Zambia and Kenya. Prices are an average of $360/t cfr for standard MOP and $375-380/t cfr for granular MOP.
