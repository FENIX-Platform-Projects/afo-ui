    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
The momentum of the latest price rally in the urea market appears to be fading.
Prices in the US market have dropped off for April, particularly towards the end of the month where urea barges are trading down to $230/st fob Nola, equivalent to $245/t cfr. CF continues to buy in barges, but there has been little support from other buyers.

There is still a high premium for urea arriving in the US in March, but April is the main focus for new cargoes with nearly 1mn tonnes booked to arrive. With April US prices falling, traders have reduced their bids vessels to load in March.

This was highlighted in two sales tenders in North Africa, each for 25,000t of granular urea. Algerian and Egyptian producers were hoping to repeat the prices above $250/t fob seen in February for prompt shipments for the US, but prices fell to about $240/t fob.

The actions of buyers in Asia, Europe and Latin America will become increasingly influential as March progresses and urea loading for the US slows. So far they have shrugged off the surge in the US prices, and this tactic appears to be paying off. Latest granular urea sales in Central America have taken place in the range $220-230/t cfr, and prices in Brazil are moving down again to the low-$200s/t cfr.

April looks like the next shipment period during which traders will start to sell short again. The question, how long will that take to happen?


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
The Helwan, Alexfert and EFC urea plants returned to production after a shutdown of five days during February. Mopco restarted production on 22 February. One line is running and a second line is starting up. It is said to have 25,000t of granular urea to sell for March loading, which has now been sold to Trammo.

Helwan held a sales tender on 24 February for 25,000t for mid-March loading. Several trading companies sent their regrets and Helwan is reported to have received a highest bid at $240/t fob. An award was pending at presstime.

Alexfert was supplying February commitments and offered March tonnage.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
AOA invited bids on 25 February for 25,000t of granular urea for early-March shipment. An award was made at $241/t fob to Trammo.

Sorfert was offering urea for March loading on the usual basis of Egypt fob plus a premium of about $5/t. A second trader has agreed a fixed price for 25,000t to load prompt for the US.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Kenya</h4>
Demand exists for 25-30,000t of prilled urea for end-March/April shipment.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Kenya/Tanzania</h4>
ETG is shipping  a cargo with 10,000t of prilled urea and 30,000t of DAP from Phosagro to Mombasa and Dar es Salaam in March.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Profert was expected to load 20-25,000t of granular urea in the AG in early-March for shipment to Cape Town.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
The global phosphates market resembled a giant see-saw through February, with prices west of Suez rising while there had been a corresponding fall in prices in the east. Cfr prices globally have more or less settled at a similar number in the major markets.

The rebound in the Brazilian market has continued with Russian MAP reportedly trading at $360/t cfr. Production cuts in the US and OCP's apparent withdrawal are the catalysts for the continued recovery but demand is still very thin. Some still believe the recovery is artificial as a result - hence the uptick may be short-lived.

Moreover, there comes a point when Chinese 11-44 becomes viable in the Brazilian market, if 11-52 prices rise much further. Current prices for 11-44 are around the $290s/t cfr  versus fresh asking prices around $290-295/t fob. Add $18/t freight and this equates to $310/t cfr. Allowing for differing nutrient content this equates to roughly $360-365/t cfr, more or less where 11-52 prices are now. Most traders believe that Chinese MAP availability will increase in April, hence the upside is going to be short-lived. Much depends on the eventual strength of Brazilian demand. If strong, then key suppliers of 11-52 may attempt to raise prices, allowing further hikes in 11-44 as a result. 

East of Suez, Pakistan stepped in for a third cargo of DAP, this time from China and reportedly done around the low/mid-$360s/t cfr, possibly reflecting $350/t fob China. Further demand is evident in order to average out stock values. However, the price is significantly down on last business done at $380/t cfr for Australian. Slow demand and high stocks have since stymied further demand. India is beginning to sniff regarding 2016-17 shipments, with provisional prices around $360/t cfr, subject to finalisation of the DAP subsidy. 

The market remains in fundamental oversupply. Moreover, phosphate prices often stall in April as the US season ends and India has yet to come into the market. China looks unlikely to cut production by much. The upside in Brazil is real, but trade remains thin and the level of sustainability is questionable.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP is broadly comfortable into March, with sizeable commitments in Kenya, Ethiopia and west coast Africa. It sold three 12-46 cargoes to Brazil and two DAP/MAP cargoes to Latin America through traders, with netbacks eroding into the $340s/t fob as a result. 

Moroccan DAP exports were 361,000t in December according to GTIS statistics, almost all of it going to Brazil. 2015 full year exports were 1.61mn t, a decline of 3pc. Around 622,000t were shipped to Brazil, up 160pc. A further 235,000t were moved to the US, a rise of 99pc. Another 124,000t were sold to Spain (down 40pc) and 115,000t to Turkey (up by a third). The big gains were also offset by significant drops in shipments to Bangladesh, France and Italy.

MAP exports for the full year were 1.14mn t, down 21pc. Of the total, 526,000t were shipped to Brazil, a drop of 30pc and 194,000t to the US, down 42pc. There were gains in South Africa which took 73,000t versus zero a year earlier.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
Production is running at around 60pc at GCT with healthy commitments to Turkey and Mediterranean markets into March. Last prices paid were around $370/t fob.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
Canadian potash marketer, Canpotex, announced a substantial sales volume cut amid the current unfavourable export market conditions. Canpotex said it was reducing its potash export sales volumes by 1mn t in the first quarter of 2016 and by a minimum of 500,000t in the second quarter of 2016 due to the unsatisfactory demand and prices. In the first half of 2015, Canadian MOP exports, including those shipped by Canpotex, totalled 9.9mn t, according to GTIS data. Excluding those to the US, Canadian exports were 4.9mn t.
BPC confirmed that its exports totalled 510,000-515,000t in January, down by a third on last January. The company also expected a 30pc reduction in exports over the course of the first quarter because of the current market conditions.
PotashCorp announced four-week production curtailments at its Allan and Lanigan mines in order to adjust its inventory. This will reduce its output by around 400,000t.
MOP spot buyers remained risk averse, preferring to hold off purchasing awaiting signs of market stability. At the current level of spot prices, the question of sustainability of certain production facilities continues to be raised and analyzed. 
Despite this, some early signs of improving demand emerged towards the end of February. In Brazil, buyers have been more active and suppliers have subsequently increased offer levels. In the US southern states, spring demand had begun. These two major markets have had a drag effect on global spot pricing for some time, so any sustained improvement in demand and prices, will have wider implications.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Moroco</h4>
OCP has recently booked between 30,000-40,000t of standard MOP for use in its NPK production. The purchases are reported to have been agreed at around $220/t cfr, for delivery during the first quarter. Further details including the suppliers were not disclosed, so the deals could not be confirmed.
Granular MOP has been offered to smaller buyers at €280-290/t cfr Morocco in containers.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
The severe drought conditions will impact fertilizer consumption for the next season, suppliers predict. Many farmers are struggling with debt and the country is now focused on importing massive amounts of maize to cover the domestic shortfall in production and avoid food shortages.
For November and December 2015, MOP imports totalled 69,994t, almost half the 124,839t that were imported a year earlier, according to GTIS data. More recent figures are expected to show a similar reduction when released, importers feared.
