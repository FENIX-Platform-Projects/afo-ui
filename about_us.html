                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Mission and Goals</h4>
                                Launched in 2010, AfricaFertilizer.org is a global initiative facilitating the exchange of information on soil fertility, fertilizers, and good agricultural practices in Africa. AfricaFertilizer.org contributes to the development of a sustainable and profitable agriculture sector in Africa by providing clear and accessible market information on fertilizers to the public and private sectors.
                                <br>
                                Since its creation, AfricaFertilizer.org has evolved from aggregating and disseminating existing market information on fertilizers to expanding the types of information available and also providing support to partners, programs and activities that increase the availability and quality of this information.
                                The initiative encourages and coordinates partnerships and data-sharing mechanisms that provide information on fertilizer statistics and fertilizer market intelligence.
                                <br>
                                AfricaFertilizer.org also supports the implementation of continental, regional, and national agricultural policies, to the benefit of the private sector, including smallholder farmers and agro dealers.

                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">An African Green Revolution</h4>
                                At a July 5, 2004 meeting of food security specialists in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan made an ambitious appeal for a comprehensive strategy to bring food security to Africa. While the Green Revolution had tripled food productivity in Asia, Annan highlighted, similar progress had not been achieved in Africa. “Africa has not yet had a Green Revolution of its own,” he emphasized. “Given the right kind of national and international support, Africa can achieve the 21st century Green Revolution that it needs.”
                                <br>
                                Former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo later repeated this same call. He also underscored the catalytic role of fertilizer in addressing Africa’s food shortages: “The main reason for Africa’s food shortages is soil nutrient depletion. Africa loses about US$4 billion worth of plant nutrients from its soils each year due to continuous cultivation without nutrient replenishment,” he said. “We must feed the soil that feeds the people…If Africa is to rapidly enhance its ability to feed itself, we need what the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for – a uniquely African Green Revolution. This will require an increase in the use of fertilizer…Therefore, African governments have decided to take action to catalyze large-scale adoption of fertilizer.”
                                <br>
                                Additional calls for action, on the part of late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Dr. Norman Borlaug and former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jimmy Carter, ultimately led to the 2006 Africa Fertilizer Summit, organized to create a concrete plan for Africa’s Green Revolution.
                                <br><br><br>


                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">The Africa Fertilizer Summit</h4>
                                In 2006, the historic Africa Fertilizer Summit brought together 1,100 delegates to address the complex problems facing soil fertility and food security in Africa. Among the Summit’s participants were five African heads of state, 15 ministers of agriculture and hundreds of leaders of international organizations, agricultural research centers and private sector organizations. This meeting was one of the largest in history to focus on Africa’s food issues.
                                <br>
                                The summit participants came to a consensus on the urgent need for comprehensive and continuing efforts to restore the health of Africa’s soils and feed its growing population. The participants also agreed on 12 resolutions designed to increase fertilizer use five-fold in 10 years in the Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for an African Green Revolution.
                                <br>
                                The Summit opened new windows of opportunity for agencies to address the complex issues of removing yield constraints and improving soil fertility and food security in Africa. All stakeholders realized that urgent, comprehensive and long-term actions were needed if Africa is to restore soil health and feed its burgeoning population.
                                <br><br><br>

                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">The Abuja Declaration</h4>
                                The pivotal outcome of the Africa Fertilizer Summit, the Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for an African Green Revolution, alludes to a lack of market information as an important constraint to fertilizer market development, and commits African countries to achieve a rapid increase in fertilizer use. The creation of the AfricaFertilizer.org initiative is a response to the Abuja Declaration’s confirmation of the lack of market information as an important constraint to fertilizer market development in Africa.
                                <br>
                                In the Abuja Declaration, African heads of state confirmed their commitment to achieving a rapid increase in fertilizer use across the continent: From the 2006 average of eight kilograms per hectare, the declaration called for coordinated efforts to raise the level to at least 50 kilograms per hectare by the year 2015.
                                <br>
                                To achieve this, the Declaration delineated concrete measures and actions to accelerate the accessibility, availability and affordability of fertilizers on the continent:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Harmonizing policies and regulations to ensure duty- and tax-free movement of fertilizers across regions, and the development of capacity for quality control</li>
                                    <li>Developing and scaling up agro-dealer networks to improve farmers’ access to fertilizers</li>
                                    <li>Strengthening the capacity of the private sector involved in agriculture</li>
                                    <li>Granting targeted subsidies, with special attention to poor farmers</li>
                                    <li>Improving output market incentives, particularly by accelerating investment infrastructure and strengthening farmers’ organizations</li>
                                    <li>Establishing national financing facilities for input suppliers to accelerate access to credit</li>
                                    <li>Promoting the establishment of regional fertilizer procurement and distribution facilities through strategic public-private partnerships</li>
                                    <li>Promoting national and regional fertilizer production and intra-regional fertilizer trade</li>
                                    <li>Improving farmers’ access to complementary outputs such as quality seeds, irrigation facilities, extension services, market information, soil nutrient testing and mapping</li>
                                    <li>Establishing an African fertilizer development financing mechanism.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Fertilizer use in Africa</h4>
                                Fertilizer use in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in the world, averaging less than eight kilograms per hectare annually.
                                Addressing the state of the continent’s severely depleted soils is the first and most important step to reducing food insecurity and hunger in Africa. To feed themselves and their countries, farmers must shift away from low-yielding, extensive land practices and adopt more intensive, higher-yielding practices, which require increased use of improved seeds, fertilizers and irrigation.
                                Without adequate inputs, farmers often cannot meet the food needs of their own families, much less those of a rapidly growing population. That said, Africa’s farmers face a variety of constraints including low productivity, limited access to new agricultural technologies and weak markets. Small-scale farmers in particular, who comprise the majority of the continent’s farming population, must pay two to four times the average world market price for fertilizers.

                                <br><br><br>
                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Soil health / nutrient mining in Africa</h4>
                                Africa’s per capita food production has decreased over the past three decades.
                                <br>
                                “The main reason for Africa’s food shortages is soil nutrient depletion,” said former president of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo in a follow-up call to action for action following Kofi Annan’s call for a Green Revolution in Africa. “Africa loses about US $4 billion worth of plant nutrients from its soils each year due to continuous cultivation without nutrient replenishment…We must feed the soil that feeds the people.”
                                <br>
                                Decades of soil nutrient mining have severely depleted the quality of Africa’s soils; today, their quality is the poorest in the world. Population pressures force African farmers to grow one crop after another on the same land, “mining” or depleting soils of vital nutrients. The continent’s US $4 billion loss in the worth of soil nutrients per year severely erodes Africa’s ability to feed itself. No region of the world has been able to expand agricultural growth rates, and thus tackle hunger, without increasing fertilizer use.
                                “If Africa is to rapidly enhance its ability to feed itself, we need what the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for – a uniquely African Green Revolution,” said Obasanjo. “This will require an increase in the use of fertilizer.”
                                <br>
                                Even modest fertilizer use would help replenish the soil and increase crop yields dramatically. One kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer can produce 10 to 15 kilogram of grain – but most African farmers cannot access or afford mineral fertilizer, because they live in rural areas with poor infrastructure.

                                Through its agriculture and food security arm, NEPAD aims to ensure that smallholder farmers – the majority of Africans – have better access to markets, finance and technical support, in order to improve their income and get out of poverty. NEPAD works to achieve this by bringing together key players in agriculture – such African leaders, policy makers, scientists, partners and farmers – to unleash agricultural growth and sustainable development on the continent. Through NEPAD’s Fertilizer Support Programme, the organization aims to affect policy and markets at country and regional levels to encourage the development of a sustainable market for fertilizer in Africa. The program also aims to improve farmers’ wider access and appropriate usage of fertilizer for a more productive and sustainable agricultural sector.

                                The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is an international organization dedicated to addressing the global agricultural development challenges faced by its member nations. The FAO works to eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; to make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more sustainable and productive; to reduce rural poverty; to enable inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems; and to increase the resilience of the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the production, marketing and consumption of natural resources.
                                <br>
                                The FAO provides knowledge and information, and helps developing countries and countries in transition modernize and improve agriculture, forestry, and fisheries practices, ensuring good nutrition and food security for all. One of FAO's initiatives is CountrySTAT, a web-based information technology system for food and agriculture statistics at the national and subnational levels. CountrySTAT centralizes, harmonizes, integrates and validates data on food and agriculture coming from different sources.

                                <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">CountrySTAT</h4>
                                CountrySTAT is a web-based information system housing regional, national and subnational food and agriculture statistics, with in-depth data on production levels, prices, trade and fertilizers. Operated by the FAO’s Statistical Division and covering 37 Sub-Saharan African countries (57 countries in total), CountrySTAT draws its data from various sources and harmonizes it in line with international standards. The open source software format includes data available in maps, tables and charts. The system provides improved access to food and agriculture statistics to support data analysis, evidence-based decision making, and facilitates informed policymaking and monitoring.
                                <br>
                                The CountrySTAT system is owned by its member countries, and CountrySTAT ensures the long-term sustainability of the system by continually developing the capacity of regional and national experts. AFO collaborates with the FAO’s CountrySTAT to support the formation of Fertilizer Technical Working Groups (FTWGs). FTWGs are country networks of statisticians, customs officers, private importers and fertilizer experts who are trained and invited to share data, information, intelligence and best practices, with the goal of strengthening the reliability and availability of quality data on fertilizers.

                                AMITSA is a regional agricultural input market information and transparency system promoting increased use of agro-inputs in East Africa. AMITSA involves private and public sector agro input stakeholders in collecting and processing agro input data, and the system in turn provides information on agro-inputs (including prices, best practices and benefits) to farmers, retailers, extension agents and other actors in the agro-input value chain. With in-depth information and data on international and national market prices, statistics on production and trade, business leads and company directories, as well as regulatory, policy and technical publications and market news, the system fills a critical knowledge gap on agro-inputs – contributing to regional food security and accelerating economic growth opportunities.
                                <br>
                                AMITSA was developed by IFDC in collaboration with the East Africa Community (EAC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).

                                The West Africa Fertilizer Program (WAFP) is a five-year, USAID-funded project to increase regional availability and use of appropriate and affordable fertilizers. WAFP, which began in 2012, aims to improve agriculture productivity by giving farmers better access to high quality, affordable fertilizers.
                                <br>
                                Implemented in collaboration with ECOWAS, the program aims works to reduce the cost of fertilizer so as to increase its use by smallholder farmers, to reduce the distance between the farm gate and fertilizer agro-dealers and increase the use efficiency of fertilizers by accurately matching soil type and crop variety to recommended fertilizer types and quantities. The program also works to increase the regional availability of appropriate and affordable fertilizers through increased regional supply and distribution of fertilizers by the private sector, increased use of improved fertilizers, improved efficiency of regional market transactions and improving the enabling environment for fertilizer policy and regulatory framework development in West Africa.
